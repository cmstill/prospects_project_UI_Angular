My dropdowns aren't working here but are working in my non-angular project.  Why?
	- maybe has to do w/ popper?  I need to add that in scripts in angular.json?
	- bootstrap css drop down (search term)


Favicon not displaying.
	- I have them both where they're supposed to be and referring to the correct file path I think
	- and I tried to mess with angular.json to add src/assets
	- still not working


	How to handle code for grading the players?

	ask about the selcted receiver function in ReceiversComponent...I don't really understand what is going on here
